                        From the very beginning of modern civilization,
                         we as humans have always had the need to keep
                          possessions and things we hold to value safe,
                           therefore for just as long we have been
                            developing ways in which to keep these
                             items safe.

                        History of mechanical locks started over 6 thousand
                      years ago in Ancient Egypt, where locksmith first
                      managed to create simple but effective pin tumbler
                       lock that was made entirely from wood.

                    <p>
                        Locks were developed untill they become the way 
                        we know them now.

                    <p>
                        The main principle to how Locks work is the same 
                        as the phone pin code security. But here, the code 
                        is saved in the pins pattern inside the keyway.
                        
                        Another copy of information is saved in the key blade
                        so that every lock has its own unique key to open.

                    <p>
                        The springs press all the key pins down. The driver pins 
                        are not going to be alinged with shear line. But they will 
                        all be at diffrent levels randomly.
                        
                         

                        
                    </p>
                    <img src="mechanism2.gif" class="img" title="mechanism">
                    <p>
                        When the right key is plugged into the keyway inside 
                        the lock, everything lines up with the shear line. 
                        Now the lock is ready to open.
                        <br>
                        But if you insert the wrong key, the driver pins will 
                        not line up and end up unable to open.
