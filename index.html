                     A Time Chaine organizes events linked to each other in
                      certain flow. So that an event won't happen without the effect of the previous one.
                    <br>
                    Following our Link of events represented in the cards bellow
                    will help you understanding how the wireless key works.

                    Starting from <b>The Pin Lock</b> which I bet you deal with 
                    more than once daily.

                    <br>
                    And the mechanism inside that tool will actually lead 
                    to a huge series of inventions.

                    Or maybe just the use of it in past helped keeping

                    some devises.

                            The Pin Lock is a tool used for security 
                            and privacy, and it's a mechanism for keeping 
                            any container closed. It opens using its own key 
                            that has the pin pattern. It was first created by <b>ancient
                            Egyptians</b> 6000 years ago.

                    The Pin Lock has been used on a global scale since
                    it was invented. As it inspired <b>Greeks</b> in the <b>3<sup>rd</sup> 
                    centry B.C</b> to create <b>Gears</b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The invention of Gears made a huge revolution in industry
                    through the years in construction and trasportation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the early years of the <b>19<sup>th</sup> century</b>, a German
                    inventor thought about creating a machine to transport
                    one person due to a smart design of gears. That's how 
                    the world's first <b>bicycle</b> was made.

                            A transportation machine for individuals made 
                            with a sat of gears to transform the energy 
                            generated by the human body (muscles) into 
                            kinetic energy.
                            It was first made in <b>1817</b> by <b>Karl Von Drais</b>.

                    A few decades after making the world's first bicycle,
                    inventor starts thinking of using another source of energy
                    rather than the human energy and the animal energy 
                    (horses...) and instead of steam powered engine.

                    <br>
                    Using a certain set of gears, mechanical tools and some 
                    chemistry, an <b>American engeneer</b> made the first <b>car engine</b>.

                            The Car Engine is a machine that converts the energy 
                            from the form of <b>Heat</b> made as a result of gas 
                            combustion into <b>mechanical energy</b>. The world's

                            <b>Carl Benz</b>.

                    Pin locks were used to secure them for a long time, untill
                    <b>The Wireless Key</b> was made.
