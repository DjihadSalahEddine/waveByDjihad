                    <p>
                        The story of bicycles started in Germany when a 
                        German baron named Karl von Drais made the first 
                        major development when he created a steerable, 
                        two-wheeled contraption in 1817. Known by many names,
                         including the “velocipede,” “hobby-horse,” “draisine” 
                         and “running machine,” this early invention has made
                          Drais widely acknowledged as the father of the bicycle.
                          But the bicycle as we know it today evolved in the 19th
                           century thanks to the work of several different 
                           inventors.

                    <p>
                        Well, the first design was dangerous to ride. So the 
                        design was modified to a safer and a better design 
                        that featured equal-sized wheels and a chain drive.
                        In in 1885, when Englishman John Kemp Starley perfected 
                        a "safety bicycle" design.

                        The evolution of bicycles changed by the decades so it 
                        would appear safer, more comfortable and easier to ride.

                    <h2>mechanism</h2>

                    <p>

                    The main components of a bicycle's mechanism are the 
                    two gears and the chain. Then we have the wheels, handlebars
                     and the body parts.
                    

                    
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        The crank arm uses the force applied by feet to rotate the 
                        the bottom bracket (the main gear) which translate rotaional
                        motion by the chain to one of the cassettes. This will make 
                        the bicycle moves forward.

                    <p>
                        The derailleur changes the position of the chain on the 
                        cassettes, so it can change the gear rotating with. And it 
                        workes depends on the wire's tension.
