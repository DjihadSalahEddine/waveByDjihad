                        The first combustion engine that has 
                        one-cylinder two-stroke unit was first 
                        designed a invented by the German Carl Benz 
                        in 1886.

                        "Benz"? I know that you are wondering 
                        where did you hear this word before. Yes, I know what you are 
                        thinking about, The most known car company "Mercedes-Benz".
                        The brand's origins lie in Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft's 1901
                        Mercedes and Carl Benz's 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which is
                        widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a 
                        self-propelled automobile.

                        A huge car engines evolution has accured since then.
                        Now we have 60 brands. But only 14 are majors.

                        The Car Engine may seem complicated but it won't be that 
                        complicated if you understand the main principle.

                        The air flows throught the inlet mainfold in the 
                        cylinder head. Fuls enters the engine chamber and it is 
                        also called the combustion chamber where it mixes with 
                        the air. 
                        <br>
                        The air is directly sucked into the manifold from
                        the throttle body. The fuel, on the other hand, is injected 
                        into the end of the manifold through a nozzle called the 
                        fuel injector.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The valve controles the entrance of air and fuel and
                         the exist of exhaust gas. It also keeps the air-fuel 
                         mixture sealed inside the chamber.
                         <br>
                         The valves open and close based
                           on which stroke is taking place. The opening and closing
                            of the valves are done by an actuator rod known as the camshaft.

                        The engine pistol pressess the air-fuel mixture inside 
                        the chamber. the compression of the mixture gives more 
                        energy to the reaction. When it reaches the maximum pressure, 
                        the valves close and then the 
                        role of te spark plug comes in. It lunches a spark so the 
                        combustion reaction happen.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As a result, the pistol is pushed down translating the heat 
                        energy to the crankshaft then to the gears.

                        The exaust gases leave the chamber when the exhaust valve 
                        opens exiting the car due to the exhaist system.
